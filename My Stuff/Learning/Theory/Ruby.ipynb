    "\"I have an app with a single model that contains over two thousand lines. What do you think is the problem there and what are some ways we could make the model more manageable?\" I'd hope for that question to be followed up with a nice discussion about the different approaches to separate concerns based on responsibilities of the business logic. I.e. generalize view logic into helpers, model-specific view logic into decorators or view objects, split single model into multiple models each with smaller responsibility, the ideas go on and on. That might tie into inheritance/composition or an entity-relationship/database discussion, Lot's of great ways to segue these open ended questions into other aspects of Rails and for both of us to learn about each other's skills, preferences and trade new ideas or knowledge."
