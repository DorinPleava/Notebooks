    "- Stacks and registers can't be shared among the threads. Each thread has its own stack and registers\n",

    "- Processes and threads can be considered similar, but a big difference is that a process is much larger than a thread. For that reason, it is not good to have switching between processes. There is too much information in a process that would have to be saved and reloaded each time the CPU decides to switch processes.\n",
    "- A thread on the other hand is smaller and so it is better for switching. A process may have multiple threads that run concurrently, meaning not at the same exact time, but run together and switch between them. The context switching here is better because a thread won't have as much information to store/reload.\n",
    "- If you only have a single core then you can only do concurrent execution, for the most part. Once you have multiple cores you can have threads run on both cores and thus have simultaneous execution. It is up to the Operating System to schedule when threads run, when processes get to run, when to switch, how to switch them, etc. The Operating System gives you the illusion that work is being done simultaneously when this is not always the case."
