    "## Builder\n",
    "#### Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.\n",
    "- To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls and a floor, install a door, fit a pair of windows, and build a roof. But what if you want a bigger, brighter house, with a backyard and other goodies\n",
    "- The House constructor with lots of parameters has its downside: not all the parameters are needed at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Builder pattern suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called builders\n",
    "- The pattern organizes object construction into a set of steps (buildWalls, buildDoor, etc.).\n",
    "- create several different builder classes that implement the same set of building steps, but in a different manner.\n",
    "- Director\n",
    "    - You can go further and extract a series of calls to the builder steps you use to construct a product into a separate class called director.\n",
    "    - The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps\n",
    "    - Having a director class in your program isn’t strictly necessary. . You can always call the building steps in a specific order directly from the client code.\n",
    "    - In addition, the director class completely hides the details of product construction from the client code. The client only needs to associate a builder with a director, launch the construction with the director, and get the result from the builder.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Builder interface declares product construction steps that are common to all types of builders.\n",
    "- Concrete Builders provide different implementations of the construction steps. Concrete builders may produce products that don’t follow the common interface.\n",
    "- Products are resulting objects. Products constructed by different builders don’t have to belong to the same class hierarchy or interface.\n",
    "- The Director class defines the order in which to call construction steps, so you can create and reuse specific configurations of products.\n",
    "- The Client must associate one of the builder objects with the director. Usually, it’s done just once, via parameters of the director’s constructor. Then the director uses that builder object for all further construction. However, there’s an alternative approach for when the client passes the builder object to the production method of the director. In this case, you can use a different builder each time you produce something with the director.\n",
